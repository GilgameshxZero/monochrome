# `vpn`

## Server configuration

A VPN server is available on `gilgamesh.cc`/`159.65.224.199` via instructions at <https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn>: `wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh && sudo sh vpn.sh`

IKEv2 clients may be managed with `sudo ikev2.sh` and should roughly mirror `gilgamesh-*` machine structure and naming.

## Client configuration

### IPsec/L2TP

```
Server IP: 159.65.224.199
IPsec PSK: gb3UjkTcLhvmukZCbPYi
Username: vpnuser
Password: tD2kbmZa5e65PfqG
```

### IKEv2

Multiple connections from the same router may be denied. To avoid this, connect with IKEv2.
IKEv2 clients may connect with certificates found in `monochrome/module/vpn`.

Password (if required): `zSSdRFY2tf2fyXHvYC`.

#### Windows

The IP address will need to be changed should `gilgamesh.cc` be hosted from a different IP. The following script should be run from an admin-level cmd from `monochrome/module/vpn`, and is interactive, so should be run line-by-line.

The files themselves may need to be renamed in order for the connection name to be set correctly as `gilgamesh.cc-X`, for machine `gilgamesh-X`.

```batch
SET "VPN_NAME=gilgamesh-31"
certutil -f -importpfx "%VPN_NAME%.p12" NoExport
powershell -command "Add-VpnConnection -ServerAddress '159.65.224.199' -Name '%VPN_NAME%' -TunnelType IKEv2 -AuthenticationMethod MachineCertificate -EncryptionLevel Required -PassThru"
powershell -command "Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName '%VPN_NAME%' -AuthenticationTransformConstants GCMAES128 -CipherTransformConstants GCMAES128 -EncryptionMethod AES256 -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA256 -PfsGroup None -DHGroup Group14 -PassThru -Force"
```

#### iOS

Use the `*.mobileconfig` file generated in `monochrome/module/vpn`.

## Usage

For some reason, IKEv2 clients cannot connect via `xfinitywifi` or `XFINITY` Wi-Fi hotspots. However, they may be able to form P2P connections, thus enabling VPNâ€™d bittorrent.

## OpenVPN

An experimental OpenVPN server has been set up on `gilgamesh.cc` following the guide at <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-20-04>. Note that beyond the guide, I had to disable all `iptables` rules such as what I did for `emilia`. Namely, clear IP tables and run `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens18 -j MASQUERADE;` with the correct ethernet interface name `ens18` using `ip route get`.

I also needed `tun-mtu 1400` (or 1000) on the server config sometimes. Add `ipv6` to the server pushes to ensure that client ipv6 requests do not sneak through.

The CA password is the same as the Emilia HTTP password.

```bash
cd ~/easy-rsa/;
./easyrsa gen-req gilgamesh-50 nopass;

cp ~/easy-rsa/pki/private/gilgamesh-50.key ~/client-configs/keys/;
./easyrsa sign-req client gilgamesh-50;

cp ~/easy-rsa/pki/issued/gilgamesh-50.crt ~/client-configs/keys/;
cd ~/client-configs/;
./make_config.sh gilgamesh-50;
```

```ovpn
redirect-gateway def1
block-outside-dns
```

In the server config, we may write:

```conf
push "redirect-gateway ipv6 def1 bypass-dhcp"
```

Note that the order of the pushes does matter. Notably, `ipv6` is nonstandard but prevents IPv6 DNS leaks on some clients.

Create a split tunnel on each client by routing specific subnets only:

```conf
route-nopull
route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
# route 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0
route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
```

The second route allows traffic (e.g. bittorrent) which selects only the VPN interface to route correctly. There usually exists another route `0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0` on the default interface with lower metric, so usual traffic is routed outside the VPN.

You may verify your public IP from the command line with `curl https://api.ipify.org`. For this to work properly, DNS outside tunnels must be enabled.

```conf
# ignore-unknown-option block-outside-dns
# setenv opt block-outside-dns # Prevent Windows 10 DNS leak
```
