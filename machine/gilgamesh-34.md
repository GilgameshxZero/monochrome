## Syncthing

We utilize `Syncthing-Fork` (<https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android>) which provides some battery and filesystem advantages over the official Syncthing implementation. This is not all that obvious and may be decommissioned in the future.

## Note-taking

We know that the default note-taking application stores its files in a location which is inaccessible without rooting the device.
